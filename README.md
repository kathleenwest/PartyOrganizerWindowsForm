1. Objectives

The main objectives of this assignment are:

• To learn using one-dimensional arrays.

• To learn how to write and use properties to access values saved in the private fields of an object.
In addition, exercise more with strings and also learn to use a ListBox for display of results. Keep the presentation of data (interaction with the user, input/output) from the logics behind data processing.

2. Description

Apu (a user) is often asked to manage and organize parties. He would like to have a simple application that lists the names of the people to be
invited to a party and also get an idea of the total cost based on an estimated cost per guest. We use a form object (MainForm) for the GUI and a class Party to contain the logics pertaining to party arrangements. For saving the names of the guests, use a one dimensional array of strings in the Party class. MainForm declares a variable of the Party class as its field. We refer to this object as party (with a small p). 

MainForm should handle all the interactions (input/output) between the user and the application, and it should not contain logics that is (or can be) a part of the Party class’ responsibility. Every logic concerning the party, except processing of input and display of output, should be coded in the Party class.
